# AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle)

## Description
An adaptive software development workflow that intelligently tailors itself to project needs. It guides through a structured three-phase lifecycle: Inception (planning), Construction (design & implementation), and Operations (deployment - future).

## When to Use
- When the user requests software development work (new features, bug fixes, refactoring, migrations, enhancements, new projects)
- When starting any coding task that benefits from structured planning and requirements gathering
- When the user says "start aidlc", "use aidlc", or requests a structured development workflow

## Session Resumption
If `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` exists, follow `common/session-continuity.md` to resume from where the user left off.

## Instructions

### Adaptive Workflow Principle
**The workflow adapts to the work, not the other way around.**

The AI model intelligently assesses what stages are needed based on:
1. User's stated intent and clarity
2. Existing codebase state (if any)
3. Complexity and scope of change
4. Risk and impact assessment

### MANDATORY: Startup Rules
**CRITICAL**: At workflow start, you MUST:

1. **Display welcome message** from `common/welcome-message.md` (ONCE per workflow, skip on subsequent interactions)
2. **Load common rules** and reference throughout execution:
   - `common/process-overview.md` - workflow overview
   - `common/session-continuity.md` - session resumption guidance
   - `common/content-validation.md` - content validation requirements
   - `common/question-format-guide.md` - question formatting rules
3. **Validate content** before creating ANY file per `common/content-validation.md` (Mermaid syntax, ASCII diagrams via `common/ascii-diagram-standards.md`, special character escaping, text alternatives)
4. **Format questions** per `common/question-format-guide.md` (multiple choice A/B/C/D/E, [Answer]: tags, never ask in chat)

### MANDATORY: Extensions Loading (Context-Optimized)
**CRITICAL**: At workflow start, scan the `extensions/` directory recursively but load ONLY lightweight opt-in files — NOT full rule files. Full rule files are loaded on-demand after the user opts in.

**Loading process**:
1. List all subdirectories under `extensions/` (e.g., `extensions/security/`, `extensions/compliance/`)
2. In each subdirectory, load ONLY `*.opt-in.md` files — these contain the extension's opt-in prompt. The corresponding rules file is derived by convention: strip the `.opt-in.md` suffix and append `.md` (e.g., `security-baseline.opt-in.md` → `security-baseline.md`)
3. Do NOT load full rule files (e.g., `security-baseline.md`) at this stage

**Deferred Rule Loading**:
- During Requirements Analysis, opt-in prompts from the loaded `*.opt-in.md` files are presented to the user
- When the user opts IN for an extension, load the corresponding rules file (derived by naming convention) at that point
- When the user opts OUT, the full rules file is never loaded — saving context
- Extensions without a matching `*.opt-in.md` file are always enforced — load their rule files immediately at workflow start

**Enforcement** (applies only to loaded/enabled extensions):
- Extension rules are hard constraints, not optional guidance
- At each stage, the model intelligently evaluates which extension rules are applicable based on the stage's purpose, the artifacts being produced, and the context of the work — enforce only those rules that are relevant
- Rules that are not applicable to the current stage should be marked as N/A in the compliance summary (this is not a blocking finding)
- Non-compliance with any applicable enabled extension rule is a **blocking finding** — do NOT present stage completion until resolved
- When presenting stage completion, include a summary of extension rule compliance (compliant/non-compliant/N/A per rule, with brief rationale for N/A determinations)

**Conditional Enforcement**: Extensions may be conditionally enabled/disabled. See `inception/requirements-analysis.md` for the opt-in mechanism. Before enforcing any extension at ANY stage, check its `Enabled` status in `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` under `## Extension Configuration`. Skip disabled extensions and log the skip in audit.md. Default to enforced if no configuration exists.

- `common/terminology.md` - Glossary of AI-DLC terms
- `common/overconfidence-prevention.md` - Question generation philosophy
- `common/workflow-changes.md` - Handling mid-workflow changes
- `common/error-handling.md` - Recovery procedures

**Detail**: `operations/operations.md`

---

# Key Principles

- **Adaptive Execution**: Only execute stages that add value
- **Transparent Planning**: Always show execution plan before starting
- **User Control**: User can request stage inclusion/exclusion
- **Progress Tracking**: Update aidlc-state.md with executed and skipped stages
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Log ALL user inputs and AI responses in audit.md with timestamps
  - **CRITICAL**: Capture user's COMPLETE RAW INPUT exactly as provided
  - **CRITICAL**: Never summarize or paraphrase user input in audit log
  - **CRITICAL**: Log every interaction, not just approvals
- **Quality Focus**: Complex changes get full treatment, simple changes stay efficient
- **Content Validation**: Always validate content before file creation per content-validation.md rules
- **NO EMERGENT BEHAVIOR**: Construction phases MUST use standardized 2-option completion messages as defined in their respective rule files. DO NOT create 3-option menus or other emergent navigation patterns.

## MANDATORY: Plan-Level Checkbox Enforcement

### MANDATORY RULES FOR PLAN EXECUTION
1. **NEVER complete any work without updating plan checkboxes**
2. **IMMEDIATELY after completing ANY step described in a plan file, mark that step [x]**
3. **This must happen in the SAME interaction where the work is completed**
4. **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Every plan step completion MUST be tracked with checkbox updates

### Two-Level Checkbox Tracking System
- **Plan-Level**: Track detailed execution progress within each stage
- **Stage-Level**: Track overall workflow progress in aidlc-state.md
- **Update immediately**: All progress updates in SAME interaction where work is completed

## Prompts Logging Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Log EVERY user input (prompts, questions, responses) with timestamp in audit.md
- **MANDATORY**: Capture user's COMPLETE RAW INPUT exactly as provided (never summarize)
- **MANDATORY**: Log every approval prompt with timestamp before asking the user
- **MANDATORY**: Record every user response with timestamp after receiving it
- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS append changes to EDIT audit.md file, NEVER use tools and commands that completely overwrite its contents
- Use ISO 8601 format for timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- Include stage context for each entry

### Audit Log Format:
```markdown
## [Stage Name or Interaction Type]
**Timestamp**: [ISO timestamp]
**User Input**: "[Complete raw user input - never summarized]"
**AI Response**: "[AI's response or action taken]"
**Context**: [Stage, action, or decision made]

---
```

### Correct Tool Usage for audit.md

CORRECT: Read the audit.md file, then append/edit to make changes.

WRONG: Read the audit.md file, then completely overwrite it with old contents plus new changes.
